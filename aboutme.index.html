            <p> Cormia explores the intricate aspects of the human condition that often fall victim to not being talked about. Cormia tends to focus on the perspective of women and their demons in order to demonstrate the beauty to be found in the pain that they were not only born with - but that endures with them throughout their existence. Using her signature "women with devil's horns", Cormia aims to illustrate the complexity of the inner battles many people find harrowing. In turn, Cormia strives to transform these deeply human moments into something normal, relatable, and primitive. Her goal is to inspire not only introspection but also an appreciation for these formidable moments, so that the viewer wants to display them rather than view them as shamefully hidden secrets. Her process is informed by both her own experience as well as that of her friends and acquaintances. Cormia takes the time to engage with the emotions of these experiences and to visualize them into something enchanting, appealing, and meaningful.</p>
